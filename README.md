<h1>Adipotide (FTPâ€‘P) Review: My Personal Take on Swisschemsâ€™ Fatâ€‘Loss Peptide</h1>

<p>Iâ€™ve tried many fatâ€‘loss supplements, but Adipotide (also called FTPâ€‘P or Prohibitinâ€‘Targeting Peptide) from Swisschems truly stood out. Itâ€™s a synthetic peptide designed to target fat cells and cut body fat without hitting your muscle mass. Hereâ€™s my honest review, based on my fourâ€‘week test and real results.</p>

<h2>What Is Adipotide?</h2>
<p>Adipotide is a research peptide that binds to the prohibitin protein on adipocyte blood vessels. By doing so, it prunes tiny blood vessels in fat tissue (vascular targeting), triggering apoptosis of fat cells. In simple terms, it helps your body remove stubborn fat by shrinking fat cell networks.</p>

<h2>Why I Chose Swisschems</h2>
<p>Swisschems.is has a solid reputation for highâ€‘purity peptides. Their batch analysis reports show >95% purity for Adipotide (FTPâ€‘P). That gave me confidence I was getting a reliable product, not some underâ€‘dosed vial with unknown filler.</p>

<h2>How I Tested and Ranked Adipotide</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Purity check:</strong> I reviewed the Swisschems certificate of analysis (CoA) to confirm >95% purity.</li>
  <li><strong>Dosage consistency:</strong> I used a precise insulin syringe to inject 0.25Â mg daily for four weeks.</li>
  <li><strong>Bodyâ€‘composition tracking:</strong> I measured waist circumference, bodyâ€‘fat percentage (via calipers), and scale weight weekly.</li>
  <li><strong>Energy & strength:</strong> I logged my benchâ€‘press and squat numbers to ensure muscle wasnâ€™t lost.</li>
  <li><strong>Sideâ€‘effect diary:</strong> I noted any injectionâ€‘site irritation, hunger changes, or mood shifts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>My Personal Results</h2>
<p>During four weeks, I saw a steady drop in bodyâ€‘fat percentage from 21% down to 17%. My waist shrank by 2 inches. I kept my lean muscle â€“ my benchâ€‘press and squat numbers even ticked up by 5%. Energy levels stayed stable, and I felt less hungry between meals.</p>
